                    <h3>Reprocess your past</h3>
                    <p> Reflection on the past has a powerful effect to help uncover what has been
                        learned through development. Revisiting past trauma and understanding how it
                        causes certain decisions to be made can help give a more open mind. </p>

                    <h3>Work through the present</h3>
                    <p> Feeling stuck or overwhelmed is perfectly normal. Regardless of your unique story, all clients
                        have problems in the present that seem daunting, and we are here to help. Life Counseling Clinic
                        aims to retrain the nervous system through multiple methods. Healthy coping mechanisms, proper
                        emotion identification, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and more help our clients live in the
                        moment instead of in their mind.

                    <h3>Control your Future</h3>
                    <p> The future can be uncertain, and we're here to help. Counselors can help clients better
                        understand purpose, motivation, and
                        options available to each individual's concerns. Counselors at Life Counseling Clinic work with
                        a licensed social work
                        (LCSW) counselor who can weigh in, if explicit permission is given, to provide unique
                        resources and connections in your area.
